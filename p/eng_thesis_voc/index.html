<li>Technological revolutions have recently hit the industrial world</li>
<li>The advent of &hellip; systems for has had a significant impact on the</li>
<li>The development of &hellip; is explored</li>
<li>During the past decade, the theory of fuzzy sets has developed in a variety of directions</li>
<li>The concept of xx was investigated quite intensively in recent years</li>
<li>There has been a turning point in &hellip; methodology in accordance with the advent of &hellip;</li>
<li>A major concern in &hellip; today is to continue to improve&hellip;</li>
<li>A xx is a latecomer in the part representation arena.</li>
<li>At the time of this writing, there is still no standard way of xx</li>
<li>Although a lot of effort is being spent on improving these weaknesses, the efficient and effective method has yet to be developed.</li>
<li>The pioneer work can be traced to xx [1965].</li>
<li>To date, none of the methods developed is perfect and all are far from ready to be used in commercial systems.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="objective--goal--purpose">Objective / Goal / Purpose</h3>
<ol>
<li>The purpose of the inference engine can be outlined as follows:</li>
<li>The ultimate goal of the xx system is to allow the non experts to utilize the existing knowledge in the area of manual handling of loads, and to provide intelligent, computer aided instruction for xxx.</li>
<li>The paper concerns the development of a xx</li>
<li>The scope of this research lies in</li>
<li>The main theme of the paper is the application of rule based decision making.</li>

<li>The main objective of such a &hellip; system is to</li>
<li>The aim of this paper is to provide methods to construct such probability distribution.</li>
<li>In order to achieve these objectives, an xx must meet the following requirements:</li>
<li>In order to take advantage of their similarity</li>
<li>more research is still required before final goal of &hellip; can be completed</li>
<li>In this trial, the objective is to generate&hellip;</li>
<li>for the sake of concentrating on &hellip; research issues</li>
<li>A major goal of this report is to extend the utilization of a recently developed procedure for the xx.</li>
<li>For an illustrative purpose, four well known OR problems are studied in presence of fuzzy data: xx.</li>
<li>A major thrust of the paper is to discuss approaches and strategies for structuring ..methods</li>
